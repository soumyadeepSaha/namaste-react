    NOTE:=> WE CALL REACT AS A LIBRARY
 LIBRARY & FRAMEWORK(DIFF)
 we call react as a library because react can be applied to a small portion of a page
 ex_ (react can workon footer,header,sidebar) any where 
 // it will work only at that place where you make your root as

 // so react can work indipendently on your app as well

 // it is not a full fledged frame works

//a frame works is a framework which comes with all loads of things
//where as react is a barebone minimal js library it s just some piece of js code written by facebook developers
